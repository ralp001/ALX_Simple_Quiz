        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. In simpler terms, it's about teaching computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.\n"

Its significance is that it protects users from malicious content, phishing attempts, and unwanted advertisements, keeping inboxes safe and clean."

For example, the word \"bank\" could mean a financial institution or the side of a river. NLP systems must be able to resolve this ambiguity, which requires complex algorithms and contextual understanding.\n",

        "**Syntax and Semantics**: NLP has to understand both the grammatical structure of a sentence (syntax) and the meaning of the words and their relationships (semantics). A computer needs to know not just that a sentence is grammatically correct but also what it means. This is a complex task because the rules of language are often inconsistent and have many exceptions."
